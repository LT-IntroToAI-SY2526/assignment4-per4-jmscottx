# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?

The most difficult part was not coding the game, but deciding a win and a loss based on player input.


2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.

In order to have a CPU, I would create a function that is able to interact with the tic tac toe board. This way, the player can interact with the board, and the CPU can also interact in opposition to the player.

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.

In order to get the CPU to play the best move, I would program sense into the CPU feature (in the form of predictable moves) and allow the CPU to counteract the moves of the player. For example if ______, then _____.
